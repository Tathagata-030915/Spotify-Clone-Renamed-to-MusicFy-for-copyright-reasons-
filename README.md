## HTML Code Explanation

### Document Type Declaration (DOCTYPE)
- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration specifies the document type and version of HTML being used.

### HTML Document Structure
- The `<html>` element is the root element of the HTML document.
- The `lang="en"` attribute specifies the language of the document.

### Head Section
- The `<head>` section contains meta-information about the document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and links to external resources like stylesheets and icons.
- Meta tags (`<meta>`) specify metadata such as character set and viewport settings.
- External CSS files are linked using the `<link>` tag.
- The `<title>` tag sets the title of the document displayed in the browser tab.
- The favicon (icon displayed in the browser tab) is specified using the `<link>` tag with the `rel="icon"` attribute.

### Body Section
- The `<body>` section contains the content of the HTML document.
- Content is divided into two main sections: a left side (`<div class="left">`) and a right side (`<div class="right">`).
- The left side contains elements such as navigation links, a logo, and a library section.
- The right side contains elements such as a header, buttons, and playlists.

### CSS Classes and Styling
- Various elements are styled using CSS classes such as `bg-black`, `bg-grey`, `rounded`, `m-1`, `p-1`, etc.
- Styling is applied for layout, colors, borders, and spacing.

### JavaScript
- JavaScript functionality is included at the bottom of the HTML document using the `<script>` tag with the `src` attribute pointing to an external JavaScript file.
